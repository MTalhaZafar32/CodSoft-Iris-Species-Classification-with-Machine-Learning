# Iris Species Classification with Machine Learning

Welcome to the "Iris Species Classification with Machine Learning" project repository! This Python project focuses on classifying iris flowers into their respective species using various machine learning models. The goal is to achieve accurate and reliable classification based on the iris flower's features.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into their species using machine learning models. The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Exploration:** In this stage, we explore the dataset to understand its characteristics and features. We aim to gain insights into the iris flower characteristics and their species distribution.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing involves tasks such as handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing the dataset for machine learning.

3. **Machine Learning Models:** We apply Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression models to classify iris flowers into their species based on their features.

4. **Evaluation:** The models' performance is evaluated, and precision, recall, and F1-scores are analyzed.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
Iris-Species-Classification/
├── data/
│ ├── Iris.csv
│ ├── Iris_prediction.csv
├── notebooks/
│ ├── Iris_Working_File.ipynb
├── README.md
└── .gitignore

```


- The `data/` directory contains the dataset used for iris species classification (`Iris.csv`) and the predicted values (`Iris_prediction.csv`).
- The `notebooks/` directory includes the Jupyter notebook `Iris_Working_File.ipynb`, where the analysis and application of machine learning models for iris species classification are performed.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/MTalhaZafar32/CodSoft-Iris-Species-Classification.git
   
2. Explore the Data: Navigate to the data/ directory to find the dataset (Iris.csv) containing iris flower features and the predicted values (Iris_prediction.csv).

3. Notebook Analysis: Open the notebooks/Iris_Working_File.ipynb notebook to view the analysis and application of machine learning models for iris species classification.

## Data Files
`Iris.csv`: The dataset containing information about iris flowers, which is used for species classification.
